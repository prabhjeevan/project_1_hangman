# __HANGMAN__

Welcome to the world's best _HANGMAN_ game

A very normal hangman game but with the option of chooding between different categories. You get to pick what your interest is in and what you are good at or you can challenge yourself and select random. If random button is clicked, the computer will randomly select a word from any of the other categories and present it to you. 



#### __When you first open the game you will be presented with this screen.__

 * _Very simple intro screen displaying title and instructions at the top on how to get started and the buttons to pick the categories on the right hand side. It also displays the number of lives the player begins with._

 Once the player selects a category the blanks will show up along with the keyboard buttons and a reset button. The reset button gives the player to reset the game and bring them to the intro page if they wanted to stop playing or choose a different category. The background and the title at the top also changes to something that relates to the category in order to help the player remember what kind of words to guess for. 

__Here is the display of that.__

The player gets to pick the letters of their choice which they think will fit the randomly selected word. Once a letter is picked the button will then become hidden so they player knows what letters have been picked. If the random word contains the clicked letter it will display in the correct dash and game will go on as normal. However, if the  clicked letter is not in the word, the remaining lives will go down by one and the hangman image will change. 

__The next image displays what the screen looks like once the player has run out of all the chances and were not able to guess the word.__

The technologies used in this project were __HTML, CSS, and Javascript.__ Aside from the web technologies I used __Adobe Photoshop__ to create all the images for the backgrounds, all six images for the hangman figure itself and the gif in the intro screen.

I am very proud of how the game turned out as I tried my best to think from the players perspective. For example: Giving the player the freedom to choose out of the categories instead of forcing a random word out to them from any category. The player should feel that they are being catered to. I placed instructions very clearly at all steps of the game so the player does not feel lost. One last thing I had in my mind was to give the player a closure if they do lose the game rather than leave them hanging. I did this by displaying the word they were trying to guess at the end with the "YOU LOST" and "PLAY AGAIN" message. This is very helpful as it gives the player comfort, confidence, and manipulates them to think that this wasn't actually that hard. The player will be more likely to play again. I believe that this game is designed well however, there is always room for improvement. 

__NEXT STEPS :__
* For my next steps I would like to make his game even more interactive. One thing I plan to include in the future are sound effects. Getting a response from the computer in any way is usually very comforting and I belive sound can do just that by assuring the player that what they are trying to good is going through. I would also add sounds to the win or lose message. 

* Another aspect I would like to add to my game is the hint button. I would like to associate a hint with each word in my array which will be displayed if the player clicked the hint button. This would help the player by a lot as sometimes you need a little push to get the answer. This hint will do just that; it will act as a boost. 

* In terms of coding and becoming a real developer I could definitely improve on making more commits and following a good routine when coming up with something new. I learnt my lesson the hard way when I spent 2 days just working on the styling aspect of the game and then realizing I would need much more time on actually getting the functionatily to work. So note to self for the future is to get the app working first and then styling can happen at last. 

__Hope you enjoy the game.__
